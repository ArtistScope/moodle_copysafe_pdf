  PDF for Moodle</b></p>
This Plugin enables the insertion of encrypted PDF documents created 
by CopySafe PDF into Moodle posts and pages with shortcode. The 
				resulting embedded document object is supported in popular web 
				browsers across all Windows computers starting from XP (92% of net users) 
up to the current version.<br>

                  CopySafe PDF documents can be easily added to any pages or 
posts created by Moodle.<h3>
				How this Moodle Plugin Works</h3>
				When editing a page or post, you may insert the short code by clicking on the [PDF] icon above the HTML editor toolbar where the cursor was last placed in the text area. After uploading or selecting an existing PDF class file (from a previous upload), you can then nominate the security settings to use for the page or post. Different pages can use different security and display settings:<br><br>

  </tr>

				<h3>Default Settings for This Moodle Plugin</h3>
				Default settings can be applied to all CopySafe PDF pages and 
				posts. Most useful for corporate networks and others who need to 
				limit access to certain types of web browsers, the default 
				settings page allows you to nominate which ones you want to 
				allow. Any browsers not qualifying will be redirected. You can 
				also select from 3 modes, which can be changed at any time: <br>

				<h3>CopySafe PDF Licensing</h3>
				
<p>The CopySafe PDF Protector enables the encryption of PDF documents for distribution 
  by email, download and disk with copy protection options and the ability to 
  assign DRM control. It can also convert protected PDF for display online, from 
  a web page, using the web browser Plugin included with the CopySafe PDF Reader. 
  Such documents encrypted for online use do not need to be domain locked. However, 
  domain locking is most recommended to prevent their display on other websites. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Every <a href="http://www.artistscope.com/copysafe_pdf_protection_licensing.asp" target="_blank">CopySafe 
  PDF&nbsp;Protector license</a> provides for unlimited use and includes free 
  DRM hosting to manage subscribers. But it does not include licensing for online 
  display using Domain Lock. If the Protector is unlicensed documents distributed 
  for local viewing will include a watermark and documents displayed online with 
  a Domain Lock will not be secure. ArtistScope oversees the use of domain lock 
  in CopySafe PDF by requiring the registration of each separate site (fee applies). 
  <br>

  Otherwise, the free trial version of <a href="http://www.artistscope.com/copysafe_pdf_protection_download.asp" target="_blank">CopySafe 
  PDF Protector</a> can be downloaded for evaluation to create encrypted PDF documents 
  to upload for testing with this Moodle module. </p>
